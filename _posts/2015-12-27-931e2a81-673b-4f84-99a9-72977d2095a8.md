My name is Josh Galt. I'm an artist, an athlete, and an entrepreneur, and I'm quite fond of chasing sunshine & h2o around the planet.

## **WORLD OF MOVING WATER**

• Riverboarding is not just something I do - it has been a big part of who I am, and it has [real potential to change people's lives][0]  
• I've riverboarded all across the USA and in Canada, Costa Rica, 
Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Spain, France, Norway, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Laos, Japan, & New Zealand...  
• [Riverboarded the ~15m Hollin Chico falls in Ecuador][1],
the highest successful waterfall descent by riverboard in the world 
since legendary explorer Mike Horn's world record 22m+ waterfalls on a 
hydrospeed in the 1990's  
• Numerous "First Descents" on a riverboard - supposedly, but who really knows who was actually first since [indigenous peoples all over the world have long used tree trunks to play in the river, and still do.][2] But at least in modern times I have many known first riverboarding descents including the noteworthy high-water [Kyotsu River][3] in Japan, the [Green River Narrows][4] and [Gorilla rapid][5] in North Carolina, and the aforementioned Hollin Chico falls in Ecuador.  
• Have been very influential with board and gear usage for 
riverboarding, experimenting with gear from other sports and adapting it
to riverboarding. Gear which I've promoted via Face Level has typically
become among the most-used type of gear for that area (helmets, fins, 
gloves, boards, protection, etc).

## WHO IS JOSH GALT?

1. I believe in [Love][11].
2. I believe I am capable of greatness.
3. I believe the entirety of my life is an art form.
4. I believe the people I Love are a reflection of my deepest [values][12].
5. I believe the meaning of Life is to fulfill my own uniquely created purpose.
6. I believe the sum of my Life will be a direct result of my self discipline.
7. I believe in Truth, Justice, and the Logical way.
8. I believe in seeking perfect flow.
9. I believe in [I][13].

+ I was born with a different [name.][14]  
+ I spent my childhood in a one room log cabin with no electricity or 
running water, miles from the nearest neighbors, on a massive lake with 
bears, moose, and porcupines in central British Columbia. I also lived 
on the reservation in Montana, and a rural farm in Oregon.  
+ I grew 
up without TV or much exposure to pop culture, which forced me to use my
mind and be creative, since boredom was never allowed. My parents 
pushed me in that regard, and I'm very grateful.  
+ I'd lived in 
Ghana, worked in orphanages in Romania, and photographed King Cobras up 
close in Nepal before graduating high school. My parents also got me 
addicted to traveling. Sweet!  
+ Since leaving home I've lived life 
creating, traveling, and exploring the planet as a whitewater athlete, 
and I've put boots on the ground on every inhabited continent (no 
Antarctica yet).
