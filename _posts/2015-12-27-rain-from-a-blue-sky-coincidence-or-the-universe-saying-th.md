She's Buddhist, which isn't even supposed to be a religion (according
to the Buddha himself), but whatever. These days I pretty much dismiss 
all religions equally, except for the ones that essentially hate life 
itself -- they're despised on a different level.

I didn't think much of it though and we continued our lunch, a nice 
breeze blowing through our flat, the river and city far below bathed in 
the mid-day sun.

And then, a few minutes later, out of nowhere came rain. Heavy, 
tropical rain, blowing sideways. We had to slide the glass doors closed 
to keep the floor from getting soaked.

A bit surprising, but it's the tropics, it happens. 

But then it was gone. In less than 5 minutes, the balcony completely soaked, the rain dissipated and the sun came back out. 

To make the point stronger, it hadn't rained all day, and it hasn't 
rained since. Sun, all day. Except for those 5 minutes, coming just 
minutes after she'd put the dish of food out on the balcony, presumably 
as an offering of some sort (she doesn't try and explain, because she 
knows I'll try and logically talk her out of believing in it).

It
made me laugh, and still does. Because while my parents would call it 
some kind of witchcraft, if I had a dollar for every time my mom has 
claimed that she prayed and God changed the weather for her, well...

So I guess the discussion point is that if a Christian had walked out
and prayed for rain, and then coincidentally it rained 5 minutes later,
that'd be God, but if a Buddhist puts out an offering and then 
coincidentally 5 minutes later it pours, then the sun comes back out, 
that's either nothing (just a "coincidence") or it's witchcraft. 

It _couldn't possibly_ be the universe noticing and showing gratitude...or could it?

I do believe we live in a spiritual world, and I happen to like parts
of the Buddhist belief system as a way of living and interacting with 
others and the world around one's self.

So is it possible that as she was doing a kind deed externalized into
the universe, the universe was really saying thank you? Is it just 
coincidence? Or was it the devil himself?

Considering this girl's heart is more "good" and despite not having 
much she's more giving than most well-off Christians I know, I'm pretty 
sure the devil had nothing to do with anything -- and anyone who'd 
believe that has some serious issues.

Which leaves either coincidence or some kind of universal statement of gratitude.

Everything is energy, and everything is connected...so I'll go with the
latter. I have no idea what it might mean, but it's kind of cool. 

If "God is Love" as theologians have stated, then why wouldn't Love 
say thank you in a tangible, creative way, in response to a humble act 
of deep gratitude, rooted in a love for life itself?
